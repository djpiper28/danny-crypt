# danny-crypt
danny crypt is a very bad symmetric key fisteal based cipher. I give it 1/10 I only it trust it for encrypting my 10GiB homework folder.

`make`/`make all` to get the standalone version
`make png` to get the classic encrypt tux thing

 Usage `./dannycrypt [KEY]` then pipe plain/ciphertext into stdin and the output is cipher/plaintext
